# Radar Signal Simulation

A Python-based simulation of radar detection with randomly placed objects.  
This project can also be integrated with a **Raspberry Pi** using a **servo motor** and an **ultrasonic sensor** for real-world radar experiments.

---

## Features
- Simulates radar sweeps and object detection in real-time.
- Generates random objects dynamically within the radar range.
- Visual display of radar sweep using `pygame`.
- Can be extended for hardware integration with Raspberry Pi.

---

## Technologies / Modules Used
- `os` – for file and system operations  
- `pygame` – for graphical display of radar and objects  
- `math` – for calculations and object positioning  
- `random` – for generating random objects
